## An Ensemble transform Kalman filter with observation error covariance estimation
### Overview 
This repository includes software for the Ensemble transform Kalman filter with online time-dependent observation error covariance estimation developed in Waller (2013) and Waller et al. (2014). The method allows spatially correlated and time-dependent observation error to be diagnosed and incorporated in an ensemble data assimilation system. The method combines an ensemble transform Kalman filter with a method that uses statistical averages of background and analysis innovations (the so-called Desroziers diagnostic, henceforth denothed the DBCP diagnostic (Desroziers et al., 2005)) to provide an estimate of the observation error covariance matrix. 

### Background

Data assimilation techniques combine physical observations of a dynamical system with a model prediction of the state of the system, known as the background state, weighted by their respective error covariance matrices, to obtain a best estimate of the current state of the system, known as the analysis. We denote here ***x***<sub>n</sub><sup>*f*</sup> &isin; &reals;<sup>*N*<sup>*m*</sup></sup> as the background state, ***x***<sub>n</sub><sup>*a*</sup> &isin; &reals;<sup>*N*<sup>*m*</sup></sup> as the analysis and ***y***<sub>n</sub> &isin; &reals;<sup>*N*<sup>*p*</sup></sup> as the observations at time *t*<sub>n</sub>, and the covariance matrices of the errors in the background and observations by ***P***<sub>n</sub><sup>f</sup> and ***R***<sub>n</sub> respectively. The background at the next step of the assimilation process is generated by evolving the (possibly nonlinear) dynamical model of the system ***M***<sub>n</sub> forward from the analysis.

Until recently the observation error covariance matrix has been assumed uncorrelated. However, it has been shown that the error is correlated Waller et al. (2013) and that the inclusion of the correlated errors in the assimilation leads to: a more accurate analysis, the inclusion of more observation information content and an improvement in the NWP skill score Stewart et al. (2013),
Weston et al. (2014).

### Desroziers et al. Diagnostic

The DBCP diagnostic described in Desroziers et al. (2005) shows that the observation error covari-
ance matrix can be calculated using, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***R*** &asymp; E[(***y***-***Hx***<sup>a</sup>)(***y***-***Hx***<sup>f</sup>)<sup>T</sup>], (1) 

where the observation operator, ***H***, maps from model to observation space. Equation (1) is valid if the observation and forecast errors used in the gain matrix,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***K*** = ***P***<sup>f</sup>***H***<sup>T</sup>(***H******P***<sup>f</sup>***H***<sup>T</sup> + ***R***)<sup>-1</sup>, (2) 

to calculate the analysis, are correct. However, the estimated observation error statistics  may be imporved with successive iterations of the diagnostic (Desroziers et al., 2005). Furthermore, the diagnostic can still provide useful information about the true observation uncertainties (Waller et al., 2016).

### Ensemble transform Kalman filter with R estimation

The ETKFR uses the ETKF and the DBCP diagnostic to estimate a possibly non-uniform time varying observation error covariance matrix. After the filter is initialised the filter is split into two stages. The first is a spin-up stage that runs for a predetermined number of steps, *N*<sup>s</sup>, and is an application of the standard ensemble transform Kalman filter. In the second stage at each assimilation step the observation error covariance matrix is updated using the DBCP diagnostic. We now present in detail the method that we have developed. Here the observation operator, **H**, is chosen to be linear, but the method could be extended to account for a non-linear observation operator ***H*** (e.g. Evensen (2003)).

## Overview of ETKFR source code 
The ETKFR software is written in Matlab and consits of three functions. The main function is `ETKFR.m` and this in turn calls
the functions `enkf_forecast.m` which forecasts the ensemble members and `etkf_analysis.m` which performs the analysis step. 

We provide an additional mfile `Homogeneous.m` a regularisation method that may be used to regularise the estimated matrix.

We now give specific details of each function.
